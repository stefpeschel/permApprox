\title{Summary method for permApprox results}
\usage{
\method{summary}{perm_approx}(object, digits = 3L, alpha = 0.05, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{"perm_approx"}, as returned by
\code{\link{perm_approx}}.}

\item{digits}{Integer. Number of significant digits to display for
numeric summaries. Default is \code{3}.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric scalar in \code{(0, 1)}. Significance level used
to count rejections based on the final (possibly adjusted) p-values
in the summary output. Default is \code{0.05}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods (currently
ignored).}
}
\value{
The input object \code{object}, invisibly.
}
\description{
Provides a more detailed summary of a \code{"perm_approx"} object than
\code{print()}, including fit status counts, summaries of fitted
parameters, goodness-of-fit p-values, and empirical vs. approximated
p-value summaries.
