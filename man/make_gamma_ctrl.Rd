\title{Create a control list for Gamma approximation in permAprox}
\usage{
make_gamma_ctrl(include_obs = FALSE, gof_test = "cvm", gof_alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{include_obs}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the observed test statistic is
included into the tail approximation (considered as permutation test
statistic). Default: \code{FALSE}.}

\item{gof_test}{Character. Goodness-of-fit test for the Gamma distribution.
Options: "cvm" (Cramer-von-Mises), "none". Default: "cvm".}

\item{gof_alpha}{Numeric. Significance level for GOF test (0 < gof_alpha < 1).
Default: 0.05.}
}
\value{
A named list of class "gamma_ctrl" containing Gamma settings.
}
\description{
Constructs a list of control parameters for the Gamma distribution
approximation method used in permAprox.
