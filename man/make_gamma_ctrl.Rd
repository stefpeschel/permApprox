\title{Create a control list for Gamma approximation in permApprox}
\usage{
make_gamma_ctrl(
  include_obs = FALSE,
  gof_test = c("none", "cvm"),
  gof_alpha = 0.05,
  fit_args = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{include_obs}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the observed test statistic is
included into the tail approximation (considered as permutation test
statistic). Default: \code{FALSE}.}

\item{gof_test}{Character. Goodness-of-fit test for the Gamma distribution.
Options: "cvm" (Cramer-von-Mises), "none". Default: "cvm".}

\item{gof_alpha}{Numeric. Significance level for GOF test (0 < gof_alpha < 1).
Default: 0.05.}

\item{fit_args}{Optional named list of additional arguments passed to
\code{fitdistrplus::fitdist()} when fitting the Gamma distribution.
Entries in \code{fit_args} must not include \code{data} or \code{distr},
which are always set internally. Typical uses are to change the
\code{method} (e.g., "mle", "mme") or provide \code{start} values.}
}
\value{
A named list of class "gamma_ctrl" containing Gamma settings.
}
\description{
Constructs a list of control parameters for the Gamma distribution
approximation method used in permApprox.
