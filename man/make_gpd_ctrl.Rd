\arguments{
\item{fit_method}{Character. Method for GPD fitting. Options: "LME", "MLE1D",
"MLE2D", "MOM", "NLS2", "WNLLSM", "ZSE". Default: "LME".}

\item{include_obs}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the observed test statistic is
included into the tail approximation (considered as permutation test
statistic). Default: \code{FALSE}.}

\item{constraint}{Character. Constraint for the fitting process.
Default: "support_at_max". Options:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"unconstrained"}}{No constraint.}
  \item{\code{"shape_nonneg"}}{Shape parameter must be non-negative.}
  \item{\code{"support_at_obs"}}{Positive density for observed test statistic.}
  \item{\code{"support_at_max"}}{Positive density for maximum of all
  observed test statistics (in the multiple testing case).}
}}

\item{eps_rule}{Choice of rule for computing \eqn{\varepsilon}. 
Allowed character values are:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"constant"}: Use a fixed \eqn{\varepsilon}. 
    The constant is defined via \code{eps_par}.
  \item \code{"factor"}: Set \eqn{\varepsilon = c \cdot |t_{\mathrm{obs}}|} 
    with \code{c} provided via \code{eps_par}.
  \item \code{"slls"}: Use the Standardized Lifted Log-Saturation (SLLS) 
    rule on the \emph{Z}-scale with permutation-based cap; \code{eps_par} 
    controls its conservativeness via \code{target_factor}. The sample 
    size must be provided via \code{sample_size} for this rule.
}}

\item{eps_par}{Adaptive parameterization for \code{eps_rule}. Its meaning
depends on \code{eps_rule}:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"constant"}: numeric. If length 1, the same constant 
    \eqn{\varepsilon} is used for all tests; if length equals the number of 
    tests, values are applied per test.
  \item \code{"factor"}: numeric scalar \code{c} used as 
    \eqn{\varepsilon = c \cdot |t_{\mathrm{obs}}|}.
  \item \code{"slls"}: Numeric scalar that is used as \code{target_factor} 
    of the epsilon function (higher \code{target_factor}
        \textrightarrow{} more conservative plateau).
}}

\item{sample_size}{Optional numeric giving the sample size. Needed for the 
"slls" rule. For groups with different sample sizes use the smaller one. 
If the sample size is unknown, use a small value (e.g., 30) to be 
conservative.}

\item{tol}{Numeric. Convergence tolerance for fitting GPD parameters.
Default: 1e-8.}

\item{thresh_method}{Character. Method for threshold detection.
Default: "ftr_min5". Options:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"fix"}}{Fix threshold (defined via \code{thresh0}).}
  \item{\code{"ftr"}}{Failure to reject.}
  \item{\code{"ftr_min5"}}{Failure to reject (min 5 subsequent acceptances).}
  \item{\code{"pr_below_alpha"}}{Proportion of rejections below alpha.}
  \item{\code{"fwd_stop"}}{Forward Stop}
  \item{\code{"gof_cp"}}{GOF change point}
}}

\item{thresh0}{Numeric or NULL. Initial threshold for defining exceedances
in the GPD fitting. Is used as fixed threshold when
\code{thresh_method = "fix"}. Set to \code{NULL} if \code{exceed0} is
provided instead. Default is \code{NULL}.
Either \code{thresh0} or \code{exceed0} must be specified (non-NULL).}

\item{thresh_step}{Integer. Step size for adaptive threshold search.
If \code{thresh_step} is 2, for instance, every second possible threshold
is considered to save runtime.}

\item{exceed0}{Numeric or NULL. Initial number of exceedances.
If less than 1, it is interpreted as a proportion of the number of
permutations. Default is \code{0.25}. Either \code{exceed0} or
\code{thresh0} must be specified (non-NULL).}

\item{exceed_min}{Integer. Minimum exceedances needed for fitting. Default: 10.}

\item{gof_test}{Character. Goodness-of-fit test for GPD. Options:
"ad" (Anderson-Darling), "cvm" (Cramer-von-Mises), "none". Default: "ad".}

\item{gof_alpha}{Numeric. Significance level for GOF test (0 < gof_alpha < 1).
Default: 0.05.}

\item{cores}{Integer. Number of CPU cores to use for parallel computations.
Must be >=1. Default: \code{1}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, progress messages are printed.
Default: \code{TRUE}.}
