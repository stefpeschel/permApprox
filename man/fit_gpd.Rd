\usage{
fit_gpd(
  data,
  thresh = NULL,
  fit_method = "MLE1D",
  tol = 1e-08,

  eps_type = "quantile",

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector. Input data to which the GPD is fitted.}

\item{thresh}{Numeric scalar. Threshold above which the data are considered exceedances.}

\item{fit_method}{Character string specifying the fitting method to be used.
Must be one of \code{"LME"}, \code{"MLE1D"}, \code{"MLE2D"}, \code{"MOM"},
\code{"NLS2"}, \code{"WNLLSM"}, or \code{"ZSE"}.}

\item{tol}{Numeric. Convergence tolerance for iterative fitting procedures.
Default is \code{1e-8}.}

\item{eps}{Numeric. A small value used in support-related constraints (e.g., added to
the upper support limit). Default is \code{0.8}.}

\item{eps_type}{Character. Type of epsilon adjustment to apply. Can be
\code{"quantile"} or \code{"fix"}.}

\item{constraint}{Character. Type of constraint to enforce during GPD fitting.
Options are \code{"unconstrained"}, \code{"shape_nonneg"},
\code{"support_at_obs"}, and \code{"support_at_max"}.}

\item{support_boundary}{Numeric or NULL. Upper boundary of the GPD support,
used in constrained fitting when the shape parameter is negative. If NULL,
the maximum of the data vector is used.}

\item{gof_test}{Character. Specifies the goodness-of-fit test to apply.
Options are \code{"ad"} (Anderson-Darling), \code{"cvm"} (Cram√©r-von Mises),
or \code{"none"}. Default is \code{"ad"}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to internal fitting functions.}
}
\value{
A named list with components:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{shape}}{Estimated shape parameter of the GPD.}
    \item{\code{scale}}{Estimated scale parameter of the GPD.}
    \item{\code{p_value}}{P-value from the goodness-of-fit test, if applicable.}
  }
}
\description{
Fits the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) to exceedances over a given threshold
using one of several available estimation methods. Optionally applies a goodness-of-fit test
to assess the adequacy of the fitted model.
}
\details{
If the shape parameter is negative (indicating a bounded tail), a constraint
may be imposed to ensure that the support of the GPD does not exceed a specified
maximum value. The \code{support_boundary} argument defines this bound and is
only relevant for such constrained fitting. The default behavior uses the
maximum observed data value unless otherwise specified.
