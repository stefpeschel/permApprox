\usage{
compute_p_values(
  obs_stats,
  perm_stats,
  method = "gpd",
  fit_thresh = 0.2,
  alternative = "two_sided",

}
\arguments{
\item{obs_stats}{Numeric vector of observed test statistic(s).}

\item{perm_stats}{Numeric vector or matrix of permutation test statistics.
For a single test, supply a vector; for multiple tests, supply a matrix
with one row per test.}

\item{method}{Character. Method used to compute p-values. Default is \code{"gpd"}.
Options are:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"empirical"}: Empirical p-values are returned directly,
  based on the number of permutation test statistics that are as or
  more extreme than the observed statistic.
  \item \code{"gamma"}: A Gamma distribution is fitted to the permutation
    distribution if the empirical p-value falls below \code{fit_thresh}.
  \item \code{"gpd"}: A Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) is fitted
    to the tail of the permutation distribution if the empirical p-value
    falls below \code{fit_thresh}.
}}

\item{fit_thresh}{Numeric. Threshold on empirical p-values below which
parametric fitting is applied. Default: \code{0.2} (parametric
approximation if the empirical p-value is smaller than 0.2).}

\item{alternative}{Character. One of \code{"greater"}, \code{"less"}, or
\code{"two_sided"} (default), indicating the tail of the test.}

\item{null_center}{Numeric or character. Specifies the value around which the
null distribution is centered. If set to \code{"mean"} or \code{"median"},
the per-row mean or median of \code{perm_stats} is used instead.
This allows testing against a null hypothesis other than zero or centering
based on the empirical distribution.}

\item{gpd_ctrl}{A control object created by \code{\link{make_gpd_ctrl}}.
Contains settings for the GPD approximation, such as the fitting method,
constraints, and thresholding strategy. Defaults to \code{make_gpd_ctrl()}.}

\item{gamma_ctrl}{A control object created by \code{\link{make_gamma_ctrl}}.
Contains settings for the Gamma approximation, including goodness-of-fit
test and inclusion of the observed statistic. Defaults to
\code{make_gamma_ctrl()}.}

\item{adjust_ctrl}{A control object created by \code{\link{make_adjust_ctrl}}.
Contains settings for multiple testing correction, such as the adjustment
method and estimation of the proportion of true null hypotheses.
Defaults to \code{make_adjust_ctrl()}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{p_values}{Numeric vector of approximated p-values. These are either
  unadjusted or adjusted for multiple testing, depending on the chosen
  adjustment method in the \code{control$adjust} settings.}
  \item{p_unadjusted}{Numeric vector of approximated but unadjusted p-values.}
  \item{p_empirical}{Numeric vector of raw empirical p-values.}
  \item{gpd_fit}{Details of GPD fit (if used), or \code{NULL}.}
  \item{gamma_fit}{Details of Gamma fit (if used), or \code{NULL}.}
  \item{method_used}{Character. Method used per test.}
  \item{adjust_result}{Full output of \code{mult_adjust()} if adjustment used.}
  \item{control}{List with the used control arguments.}
}
}
\description{
Computes empirical p-values for permutation tests.
When p-values are small, a Gamma or Generalized Pareto Distribution
(GPD) is fitted to the (tail of the) permutation distribution to improve
resolution if the number of permutations is small.
}
\details{
The function always computes empirical p-values for each test statistic by
comparing the observed statistic to the permutation distribution.
Specifically, the empirical p-value is calculated as
\deqn{p = \frac{r + 1}{B + 1}}
where \eqn{r} is the number of permutation statistics that are as or more
extreme than the observed statistic (according to the specified alternative),
and \eqn{B} is the number of permutations. This correction ensures that no
p-value is exactly zero.

If \code{method} is set to \code{"gpd"} or \code{"gamma"}, a
parametric distribution is fitted to (the tail of) the permutation
distribution for cases where the empirical p-value falls below the threshold
specified by \code{fit_thresh}.
In such cases, the returned \code{p_values} vector contains the approximated
values (empirical for larger p-values, approximated for smaller ones).

If \code{method = "none"}, only empirical p-values are returned.
