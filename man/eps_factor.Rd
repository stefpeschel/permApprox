\title{Epsilon rule: factor of support boundary}
\usage{
eps_factor(support_boundary, factor = 0.05, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{support_boundary}{Numeric scalar \eqn{>= 0}.
Upper boundary of the GPD support (on the original test-statistic scale).}

\item{factor}{Numeric scalar \eqn{>= 0}.  Multiplier applied to
`support_boundary`.  Default is `0.05`.}

\item{...}{Unused, included for forward compatibility.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar \eqn{\varepsilon}.
}
\description{
Computes \eqn{\varepsilon} = \code{factor} x \code{support_boundary}.
It is intended for constrained GPD fits where the support boundary is known
(or fixed to the maximum observed statistic).
}
\details{
If `support_boundary` is `NULL`, the function stops with an error so the user
realises a value is required.
}
\examples{
eps_factor(support_boundary = 3.2)               # 0.16
eps_factor(support_boundary = 3.2, factor = 0.1) # 0.32
