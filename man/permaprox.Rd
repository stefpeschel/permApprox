\arguments{
\item{tPerm}{numeric vector with permutation test statistics}

\item{tObs}{numeric value giving the observed test statistic}

\item{method}{character indicating the method used for p-value estimation.
Possible values are: "gpd" (default), "gamma", "empirical".}

\item{fitThresh}{threshold for initial p-value, above which a GPD or Gamma
distribution is fitted for p-value approximation (e.g. 2 times alpha).
Defaults is 0.1.}

\item{includeObs}{logical. Indicates whether the observed test statistic
should be included in the permutation distribution.}

\item{fitMethod}{...}

\item{threshMethod}{method for threshold detection.
Possible values are:
"fix", "ftr", "minPR", "PRbelowAlpha", "fwdStop"}

\item{exceedMin}{minimum number of exceedances}

\item{stepSize}{numeric giving the value by which either the threshold or the
number of exceedances is increased in each step, depending on threshMethod}

\item{gofTest}{goodness-of-fit test method}

\item{gofAlpha}{significance level of the GOF test}

\item{seed}{...}

\item{gpdEstimate}{...}

\item{nonZero}{logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), a p-value of zero is
strictly avoided.}

\item{threshMethodPar}{fix threshold/number of exceedances or start value for
threshold / number of exceedances, depending on threshMethod}

\item{ffwd}{if TRUE, large steps are made at the beginning until H0 is accepted
for the first time}

\item{fitInformation}{...}

\item{optimMethod}{...}

\item{shape0, scale0}{start value of the shape and scale parameter}

\item{shapeMin, scaleMin}{minimum value of the shape and scale parameter}

\item{shapeMax, scaleMax}{maximum value of the shape and scale parameter}
}
\description{
Approximate the p-value for a one-sided permutation hypothesis test,
  where the p-value is defined as the probability of observing a test
  statistic (in absolute terms) greater than or equal to the observed value
  under the null. Approximation methods include the empirical p-value,
  Gamma approximation, and GPD tail approximation.
